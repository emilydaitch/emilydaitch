#### Additional Info:
#### Web Development group: I am not a web developer, nor do I possess the training to be. I am just now learning basic JavaScript. I strated this group when I was inspired by the community of web-dev Twitter and wanted to experience a new side of tech, while providing a moderated and safe space for beginners to ask beginner questions. We operate through discord, and are always adding new people, so let me know if you would like to join!
